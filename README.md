# Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab

Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Project 

Packet sniffing and spoofing are two important concepts in network security;

Packet sniffing: Packet sniffing refers to the process of monitoring and capturing data packets that are being transmitted over a network. It is commonly used by network administrators for troubleshooting and analyzing network traffic.

Packet spoofing: Packet spoofing, on the other hand, involves the creation and sending of packets with false source addresses over a network. Attackers use packet spoofing to impersonate someone else or a legitimate entity.

# This lab covers the following topics:
• How the sniffing and spoofing work
• Packet sniffing using the pcap library and Scapy
• Packet spoofing using raw socket and Scapy
• Manipulating packets using Scapy
